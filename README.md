# Features

This library is build on C++ std lib types.
The library currently supports the following features, with point of customization for each:
- Sets (currently using std::tuple, but as sets. Maybe I will properly redefine sets and tuples later.)
- Element of
- Subsets
- Countability
- Infinity (infinite sets)
- Iterating finite and infinite sets
